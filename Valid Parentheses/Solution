Hint
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

Solution:-

class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Stack for left symbols
        leftSymbols = []
        # Loop for each character of the string
        for c in s:
            # If left symbol is encountered
            if c in ['(', '{', '[']:
                leftSymbols.append(c)
            # If right symbol is encountered
            elif c == ')' and len(leftSymbols) != 0 and leftSymbols[-1] == '(':
                leftSymbols.pop()
            elif c == '}' and len(leftSymbols) != 0 and leftSymbols[-1] == '{':
                leftSymbols.pop()
            elif c == ']' and len(leftSymbols) != 0 and leftSymbols[-1] == '[':
                leftSymbols.pop()
            # If none of the valid symbols is encountered
            else:
                return False
        return leftSymbols == []
