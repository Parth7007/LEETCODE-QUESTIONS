Solution:-

class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
       
        s = s.rstrip()
        
  
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == " ":
                break
            else:
                count += 1
                
        return count
